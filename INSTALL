	N.B. Your server must have short tags enabled.
	
(3). First create a user and database for Stikked using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL Administration CLI.

(4). Run the following command to setup the database structure;

	mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	
You will be prompted for the password enter it, and it will create the table structure.
