Installing stikked at the moment isn't exactly trivial in future releases there will be a wizard but at the moment here's how it goes.

(1). Download stikked from http://code.google.com/p/stikked

(2). Make sure your server supports php5 (php4 may work but it's not tested), apache and MySQL.

(3). First create a user and database for Stikked using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL Administration CLI.

(4). Run the following command to setup the database structure;

	mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	
You will be prompted for the password enter it, and it'll create the table structure.

(5). Configure Stikked

	(5.2) Open /system/application/config/database.php - and fill in the relevant information for your database.
