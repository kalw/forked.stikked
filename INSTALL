Installing stikked at the moment isn't exactly trivial in future releases there will be a wizard but at the moment here's how it goes.

(1). Download stikked from http://code.google.com/p/stikked

(2). Make sure your server supports PHP5 (PHP4 will not work), apache and MySQL.
	
	N.B. Your server must have short tags enabled.
	
(3). First create a user and database for Stikked using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL Administration CLI.

(4). Run the following command to setup the database structure;

	mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	
You will be prompted for the password enter it, and it will create the table structure.

(5). Configure Stikked
	(5.1) Open /system/application/config/config.php - and edit the base_url value.
	(5.2) Open /system/application/config/database.php - and fill in the relevant information for your database.

(6). You can configure additional options in /system/application/config/stikked.php. Including the name of your site. Which is displayed at the top of each page.

(7). Configure the cron for auto-expiration (*nix only):
	(7.1) Set the key for cron in /system/application/config/stikked.php.
	(7.2) Open a shell and run crontab -e and enter:
	
	00, 30 * * * * curl --silent --compressed http://example.com/cron/key > /dev/null 2>&1
	
	(7.2) Save and pray.

(8). Remember to modify .htaccess, you need to change the base_url to the same url you put in config.php.

(9). You should be up and running now, post any bugs to http://code.google.com/p/stikked.
