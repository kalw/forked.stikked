		PasteIO is built using The <a href="http://codeigniter.com"><strong>Codeigniter</strong></a> PHP Framework and The <a href="http://jquery.com"><strong>jQuery</strong></a> Javascript Library. It is an open-source freely available pastebin availible for download from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/PasteIO"><strong>Google Code</strong></a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		PasteIO allows you to easily <strong>share code with anyone </strong>you wish and is provided to you for free. We created PasteIO for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IRC and Private Chats were <strong>spammed</strong>.</li>
			<li>Pastebins were <strong>ugly</strong>.</li>
			<li>Pastebins were <strong>confusing</strong>.</li>
			<li>Pastebins were <strong>messy</strong> and not thought through</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="first">This resulted in a pastebin that's easy-to-use with a simple and good looking interface that lets you <strong>paste your code</strong> with ease.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		PasteIO is also available on your iphone by inserting "iphone" into any PasteIO url for example:
		
		<code>
			http://paste.mycodenow.com/view/052faec8
		</code>
		
		<br/>becomes
		
		<code>
			http://paste.mycodenow.com/iphone/view/052faec8
		</code>
	</p>

	<p>
		PasteIO is supported by <a href="http://hippstr.com">HiPPstr</a> and <a href="http://livemediaproductions.com">Live Media Productions</a>.
